This project creates a weather widget for Android (>= 2.2) that is similar
to the widget by MIUI.  It uses the same images, but has far less features.
The only purpose this project serves is for me to learn about widgets in
Android.  If you would like the full version of the MIUI widget
(far better than mine) visit: http://www.miui-dev.com/miui-weather/
